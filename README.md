# March Madness Discord Bot

## Project Goal
Build a discord bot that updates my discord server with NCAA Tournament game results after games finish.

### Data Flow
1. NCAA Tournament Game Ends
2. App pulls results results from game that ended
3. App creates results text
4. App sends results to discord server

### Things to figure out
* How to host an app in the cloud
* How to have app connect to discord server
  * How to have app send message in discord server
* Where to pull NCAA Tournament data from
* How to have an end of a game trigger the app workflow
